# FCC-JavaScript-Calculator

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/zrRzMR.
2. Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
3. Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
4. User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
5. User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
6. User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
7. Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
8. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. 
9. You can get feedback on your project from fellow campers by sharing it in our Code Review Chatroom. You can also share it on Twitter and your city's Campsite (on Facebook).
